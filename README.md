# JSONdb

So, I'm sure you once needed a module so desperately to create a database, but with JSON files??!!!!! Well, that's what I made. I was BORED, OKAY??

Check the example file if you don't know what to do.

**DO NOT PUT THIS IN ANY DIRECTORIES APART FROM THE MAIN ONE!!!!!! This needs to be in your main folder, not in src/JSONdb. Ya get what I mean blud?!!!?!!?1111
